Folk is a lightweight, portable, powerful and highly customizable content publishing platform. The goal of folk is to share your minds with the worlds easily.

Folk is developed with javascript, one of the most popular language of the world.  It's divided into two versions of node and classic asp. The node version supports sqlite (recommended) and mysql databases, and the asp version supports four kinds of databases: access, mssql, mysql and sqlite. They share the same core codes so that the extensions can also be share.

The core of Folk is lightweight, it only supplies the base article and member management. This makes you start everything easily. Meanwhile, you can make your website more personalized by custom themes. And according to the powerful plugin system, you can extend any function based on Folk as you can imagine, even a cms.

Markdown is the first choice for writing on Folk. But WYSIWYG editor plugin is also available. It's totally freedom and as you like!

## Road Map

### Cloud Platform

The Cloud-Platform is an online system to combine bloggers, that allows users to make more friends after writing, and show your website to more like-minded people.

At the same time, you can also share or sell your themes or plugins in the Cloud-Platform, or get some help to achieve the required functionality!

### Mobile Application

Living in the mobile internet era, sharing your minds, words or photos by mobile phone at anytime and anywhere, is certainly essential. Therefore, we will launch an APP at the following time to make it all better.

## About PJBlog

PJBlog is an old classic ASP blog program(since 2004) in China which has a broad customer base. After ten years of development, it's clear that she can't keep up with the times. So in 2014 we started to develop a new concept of PJBlog5, and launch a new version that is compatible with both node and asp after two years, using Folk as the development code name.

## Copyright & License

The PJBlog project was initiated by PuterJam, and the Folk version was developed by Evio and Spikef, so these three guys share the copyright.
