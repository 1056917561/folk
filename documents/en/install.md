# Install Folk

## For the Node version

### Environment

Folk(node) is built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)(recommends version>=4.0.0), lower versions(>=0.10.x) are also supported but not being tested yet.

Running Folk locally on your computer is straight forward, but requires that you install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) first.

Node.js can run at both windows, linux and MacOS, so is the same as Folk.

### About Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a modern platform for building fast, scalable and efficient web applications. Over the past 20 years, the web has evolved from a collection of static pages into a platform capable of supporting complex web applications like Gmail and facebook. JavaScript is the programming language which has enabled this progress.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) provides us with the ability to write JavaScript on server. In the past JavaScript has only existed in the browser, and a second programming language, such as PHP or ASP, was required to do server side programming. Having a web application consist of a single programming language is a great benefit, and this also makes Node.js accessible to developers who might have traditionally stayed on the client side.

The way that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) makes this possible, is by wrapping up the JavaScript engine from Googleâ€™s Chrome browser and making it installable anywhere. This means that you can get Folk installed on your computer to try it out very quickly and easily.

### Getting started

The best way to start Folk is using the installers. You can find them here: [Get Installers](https://github.com/envirs/folk/blob/master/installers).

## For the ASP version

### Environment

Folk(asp) requires Windows Server with IIS, and one of the following database ODBC drivers: access, mssql, mysql or sqlite.

### About ASP

Active Server Pages(ASP), later known as Classic ASP or ASP Classic, is Microsoft's first server-side script engine for dynamically generated web pages. 

ASP use server-side scripting to generate contents that would be sent to the visitor's web browser. The ASP interpreter reads and executes all script code between <% and %> tags, the result of which is content generation. These scripts are written using `VBScript`, `JScript` and `PerlScript`. The `JScript`, which has the same syntax with `JavaScript`, is our choice.
