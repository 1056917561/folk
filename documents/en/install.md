# Install Folk

## For the Node version

### Environment

Folk(node) is built on Node.js(recommends version>=4.0.0), lower versions(>=0.10.x) are also supported but not being tested yet.

Running Folk locally on your computer is straight forward, but requires that you install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) first.

Node.js can run at both windows, linux and MacOS, so is the same as Folk.

### About Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a modern platform for building fast, scalable and efficient web applications. Over the past 20 years, the web has evolved from a collection of static pages into a platform capable of supporting complex web applications like Gmail and facebook. JavaScript is the programming language which has enabled this progress.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) provides us with the ability to write JavaScript on server. In the past JavaScript has only existed in the browser, and a second programming language, such as PHP or ASP, was required to do server side programming. Having a web application consist of a single programming language is a great benefit, and this also makes Node.js accessible to developers who might have traditionally stayed on the client side.

The way that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) makes this possible, is by wrapping up the JavaScript engine from Googleâ€™s Chrome browser and making it installable anywhere. This means that you can get Ghost installed on your computer to try it out very quickly and easily. The following sections detail how to install Ghost locally on Mac, Windows or Linux or alternatively will help you get Ghost deployed on a server or hosting account.

### Getting started

The best way to start Folk is using the installers. You can find them here: [Get Installers](https://github.com/ohex/folk/blob/master/installers).

## For the ASP version

### Environment

Folk(asp) requires windows server with IIS, and one of the following database ODBC engines: access, mssql, mysql and sqlite.

### About ASP

Active Server Pages(ASP), later known as Classic ASP or ASP Classic, is Microsoft's first server-side script engine for dynamically generated web pages. 

ASP use server-side scripting to generate contents that would be sent to the visitor's web browser. The ASP interpreter reads and executes all script code between <% and %> tags, the result of which is content generation. These scripts are written using `VBScript`, `JScript` and `PerlScript`. The `JScript`, which has the same syntax with `JavaScript`, is our choice.
